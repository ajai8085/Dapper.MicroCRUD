## InsertRange<TEntity>(entities)
Efficiently inserts multiple entities.

## InsertRange<TEntity, TPrimaryKey>(entities, Action)
Efficiently inserts multiple entities, and for each one calls an action allowing its identity to be recorded.
:note: Only primary keys of Int32 and Int64 (`int` and `long`) type are supported, since only those are generated by the database. For all other types of primary key, pre-generate the keys and use `InsertRange<TEntity>(entities)`.

### Examples
When the Entity has a primary key of type Int32 or Int64, e.g.
```csharp
[Table("Users")]
public class UserEntity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

You can insert a range of entities, and record their generated id back in the model:
```csharp
var entities = new []
    {
        new User { Name = "Little bobby tables" },
        new User { Name = "Jimmy" };
    };

using (var transaction = this.connection.BeginTransaction())
{
    this.connection.InsertRange<User, int>(entities, (e, k) => { e.Id = k; }, transaction);

    transaction.Commit();
}
```

If you don't care about the generated id, you can simply do:
```csharp
var entities = new []
    {
        new User { Name = "Little bobby tables" },
        new User { Name = "Jimmy" };
    };

using (var transaction = this.connection.BeginTransaction())
{
    this.connection.InsertRange(entities, transaction);

    transaction.Commit();
}
```

When the entity has any other type of primary key, for instance a string or a GUID (UUID), then you must pre-generate the primary key and use the overload with the action:

```csharp
[Table("Users")]
public class UserEntity
{
    [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.None)]
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

```csharp
var entities = new []
    {
        new User { Id = Guid.NewGuid(), Name = "Little bobby tables" },
        new User { Id = Guid.NewGuid(), Name = "Jimmy" }
    };

using (var transaction = this.connection.BeginTransaction())
{
    this.connection.InsertRange(entities, transaction);

    transaction.Commit();
}
```

:note: for performance, it is recommended to wrap all bulk actions in a transaction.
