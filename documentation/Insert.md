## Insert(entity)
Inserts an entity into the table.

## Insert&lt;TPrimaryKey&gt;(entity)
Inserts an entity into the TEntity table and returns it's generated identity.

:memo: Only primary keys of Int32 and Int64 (`int` and `long`) type are supported, since only those are generated by the database. For all other types of primary key, pre-generate the key and use `Insert(entity)`.

### Examples
When the Entity has a primary key of type Int32 or Int64, e.g.
```csharp
[Table("Users")]
public class UserEntity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

You can insert the entity using the generic method to get the generated id out:
```csharp
var entity = new User { Name = "Little bobby tables" };
entity.Id = this.connection.Insert<int>(entity);
```

If you don't care about the generated id, you can just do:
```csharp
var entity = new User { Name = "Little bobby tables" };
this.connection.Insert(entity);
```

When the entity has any other type of primary key, for instance a string or a GUID (UUID), then you must pre-generate the primary key and use the non-generic version

```csharp
[Table("Users")]
public class UserEntity
{
    [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.None)]
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

```csharp
var entity = new User { Id = Guid.NewGuid(), Name = "Little bobby tables" };
this.connection.Insert(entity);
```

:memo: If you need to insert a lot of entities in one go, it's faster to call [InsertRange&lt;TEntity&gt;](InsertRange.md).
